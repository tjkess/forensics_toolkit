### FTK


## Description
- FTK is intended to be a complete computer forensics solution. It gives investigators an aggregation of the most common forensic tools in one place. Whether you are trying to crack a password, analyze emails, or look for specific characters in files, FTK has got you covered. And, to sweeten the pot further, it comes with an intuitive GUI to boot.
- There are a few distinguishing qualities that set FTK apart from the rest of the pack. First and foremost is performance. Subscribing to a distributed processing approach, it is the only forensic software that utilizes multi-core CPUs to parallelize actions. This results in a momentous performance boost; – according to FTK’s documentation, one could cut case investigation time by 400% compared to other tools, in some instances.
## personal review
I didn't use this tool i used autopsy instead when I was doing the image analysis. We went over a tutorial in class and it looked very easy to use and clean. I chose autopsy because the image feature is a little bit better and also because it downloaded first. Multiple people did the same project with FTK and were able to look at all the data just fine with this tool. 
## personal notes on usage
The only personal note I have on this is if you see an image or want to look more closely at an image use autopsy

## personal review
I used this tool in the first lab and it worked great. It was user friendly and I was able to easily copy what I needed to on to a seperate device
## personal notes on usage
Just make sure you have enough time because it can take a long time to copy everything
