## FTK


### Description
- FTK is intended to be a complete computer forensics solution. It gives investigators an aggregation of the most common forensic tools in one place. Whether you are trying to crack a password, analyze emails, or look for specific characters in files, FTK has got you covered. And, to sweeten the pot further, it comes with an intuitive GUI to boot.
- There are a few distinguishing qualities that set FTK apart from the rest of the pack. First and foremost is performance. Subscribing to a distributed processing approach, it is the only forensic software that utilizes multi-core CPUs to parallelize actions. This results in a momentous performance boost; – according to FTK’s documentation, one could cut case investigation time by 400% compared to other tools, in some instances.
### personal review
I didn't use this tool i used autopsy instead when I was doing the image analysis. We went over a tutorial in class and it looked very easy to use and clean. I chose autopsy because the image feature is a little bit better and also because it downloaded first. Multiple people did the same project with FTK and were able to look at all the data just fine with this tool. 
### personal notes on usage
The only personal note I have on this is if you see an image or want to look more closely at an image use autopsy

## Autopsy
### Description
Autopsy® is a digital forensics platform and graphical interface to The Sleuth Kit® and other digital forensics tools. It is used by law enforcement, military, and corporate examiners to investigate what happened on a computer. You can even use it to recover photos from your camera's memory card. This can be used for investigating a cyber breach on a computer network or it can be used to investigate a criminal's computer to collect evidence against him or her. 

### personal review
I used this tool when I did the analysis lab to look at the image of a computer that had been hacked. I used it to look at various files and logs to see what had happened to the computer and to get evidence and try and figure out how the attacker was able to get into the computer. This was the first time I used this tool and it was very straight forward and helpful. The timeline feature and keyword search helped make things go a lot quicker and faster in my investigation.
### personal notes on usage
If you use this tool make sure you have enough time to do the ingest. If you ingest there are some helpful features that you will have access to but it can take hours to do.
